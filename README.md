# discord-samehat

This is a silly Discord bot that replies to anyone saying "same hat" with 
the "Same Hat!" meme.

To use, set the `DISCORD_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable to your bot token. The bot
requires Node 16+ and Yarn.

This bot is MIT-licensed. You are responsible for managing the Discord Bot
App that will be associated with your instance of this bot; I won't provide a
public install link for my own instance.
